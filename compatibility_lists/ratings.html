<b>Boot:</b> if the game boots, even if nothing can be heared or seen, 1 point<br>                                    
<b>Sound:</b> if sound works at all even with major issues, 1 point. If sound works but has some issues, 2 points. If there's no known sound issues, 3 points.<br>                                    
<b>Video:</b> if anything is visible at all, 1 point. If most of the game is visible but theres some issues, 2 points. If there's no known video issues, 3 points.<br>                                    
<b>Logic:</b> if the game works in any capacity, 1 point. If the game works (including input, saving, no collision issues, with avg performance being above at least around 50% in my base hardware), 2 points. If the game has no known logic issues and run above 75% speed on my base hardware, 3 points.<br>                                    
<b>Final rating:</b> total score with the sum of all other ratings, from 1 to 10<br>                                    
<br>                                    
<b>Note:</b> if a game doesn't even boot, the rating is 0 to everything. If any other rating is below the mentioned state for 1 point, rating is 0 as well (e.g. sound no working at all makes the score for that rating 0)<br>  
<br>
<b>Base Hardware:</b> the hardware used for all the testing is a core i7-2600k (stock clock at 3.4 GHz), GTX 1050 TI. with 16 GB of DDR3 RAM
